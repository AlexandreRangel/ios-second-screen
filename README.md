# HelloApp - Sample App using the Cordova Presentation API Plugin

NOTICE: For a detailed **description** and **screenshots** of this app see the
project website: [http://fraunhoferfokus.github.io/cordova-plugin-presentation-helloapp/](http://fraunhoferfokus.github.io/cordova-plugin-presentation-helloapp/).

This sample app bases on the standard cordova sample app and extends it by a
multi-screen feature using the
[Cordova Presentation API Plugin](http://fraunhoferfokus.github.io/cordova-plugin-presentation/).
The goal of this app is to showcase the capability of the Presentation API that is
discussed by the [W3C Second Screen Presentation Working Group](http://www.w3.org/2014/secondscreen/).

Comments and contribution anytime welcome.
